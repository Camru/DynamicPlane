# DynamicPlane

This project resulted from some fun experimentation with glsl shaders and WebGL. 

After creating a "magic carpet" like plane - my original goal - I had so much fun tweaking the shader inputs, that
I added some dynamic controls to visualize how changing inputs would affect the plane geometry in real-time. 

I saved some examples of cool shader outputs that I came across while messing around with the controls.
